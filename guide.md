Hello Reader,

My name is Matthew Groves, I am a science teacher and former pastor with academic backgrounds in both religion and physics. Professionally, I work to increase scientific literacy among Christians and to foster dialogue between the scientific and faith-based communities. Recently, I have received enough questions about climate change that I decided to write a guide to the topic. Although I do include some summary, this mostly acts as an annotated map to the primary literature, so that you can find what you might be looking for. In recognizing that this is an absurd amount of material to cover, I’ve **bolded** what I believe will be the most helpful or important. If you just want the overview, I recommend the Introduction, looking over images or anything **bolded** in the body, the Conclusion, and clicking around [NASA’s site on climate change](http://climate.nasa.gov/).

If you don’t believe in climate change, this is not intended to “convert” you. But I hope it will show you the sheer bulk of evidence that has convinced 99.99% of scientists who work in the field (see the section titled “The Scientific Consensus” below).

Climate change is a scientific issue, and a policy issue, but in my mind it is foremost a humanitarian and moral issue. The world’s wealthiest people predominantly caused this problem, but the world’s poorest people will predominantly suffer its effects. For a more detailed analysis of climate change and theology, I wrote an op-ed called [“Climate Change is a Gospel issue.”](https://baptistnews.com/article/climate-change-gospel-issue-time-christians-acknowledged/)

While researching, I have – by both choice and necessity – spent considerable time wandering around corners of the internet that deny the existence of climate change. This depresses me because I believe these perspectives are, intentionally or not, hurting the standard of living of my future children and grandchildren. As a good rule of thumb, I would encourage you to always double-check the sources that individuals use. Specifically, ensure that the source references articles from peer-reviewed journals, which means the content has been analyzed by professionals in the field. There are rigorous systems in place to ensure that peer-reviewed articles are credible, and it’s a big deal to get published. It requires infinitely more credibility than simply making a blog post. If you are ever not sure if something is credible, feel free to send it to me and I’ll check it out for you. In the Age of the Internet, it can be easier than ever for less-credible voices to get attention.

Here’s a general outline that you can use as a table of contents, followed by my take on each topic. I’ve tried to include my references wherever possible so that you can read for yourself, and there are a lot of hyperlinks for easy clicking. The links are also listed at the end of the document. Feel free to email me about climate change or other science issues. I will do my best to answer your questions or steer you towards resources that can. Happy reading.

Matthew Groves

# Intro

To begin, a comment I hear a lot is “It’s arrogant to believe we can change something as large as the climate.” By a charitable reading, this has a nice dose of humility. Unfortunately, it is ultimately an opinion brought to a discussion about facts. A decent metaphor is to say that “It’s arrogant to believe we could destroy the entire Amazon forest” without checking whether or not we’re cutting down trees, and how quickly. In short, I would argue that it’s more arrogant to assume that humanity can do whatever it wants without any consequences.

Two things first, to get your feet wet. The [graph below](https://xkcd.com/1732/) is an accurate, humorous overview to get a feel for the timescale of climate change. The creator, XKCD.com, is a science humor website run by a former NASA employee named Randall Munroe. He got his data from the IPCC, which I’ll discuss below. Quality charts are worth a thousand words, and this is one of the best plots in all of science communication.  It demonstrates that the climate does indeed go through warming cycles, but not with anything approaching the severity of our warming in the last 150 years. I would encourage you to think of a person who lived “a very long time ago” (Jesus, for example) and keep that date in mind as you scroll through:

Second, the graphic below, from [this page](http://www.climate-lab-book.ac.uk/2016/spiralling-global-temperatures/), is an excellent visualization of temperature change over the last century and a half. The author, Dr. Ed Hawkins, is a Meteorologist at the University of Reading in the UK. He also references climate data from the 5th Edition IPCC report, to which he contributed.

# Data and the Science

NASA is heavily involved in climate research (we usually forget about the “Air” in National Aeronautics and Space Administration). NASA has [an entire website](http://climate.nasa.gov/scientific-consensus/) devoted to climate change, which houses huge amounts of resources. I’ve pulled three charts directly from the site here and made a small list of other recommendations below them. I encourage you to click around the “Evidence” and “Consensus” sections on the site and anything else that looks interesting.

**Temperature**: “[This graph](http://climate.nasa.gov/) illustrates the change in global surface temperature relative to 1951-1980 average temperatures. The 10 warmest years in the 136-year record all have occurred since 2000, with the exception of 1998. The year 2015 ranks as the warmest on record.”
