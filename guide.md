Hello Reader,

My name is Matthew Groves, I am a science teacher and former pastor with academic backgrounds in both religion and physics. Professionally, I work to increase scientific literacy among Christians and to foster dialogue between the scientific and faith-based communities. Recently, I have received enough questions about climate change that I decided to write a guide to the topic. Although I do include some summary, this mostly acts as an annotated map to the primary literature, so that you can find what you might be looking for. In recognizing that this is an absurd amount of material to cover, I’ve **bolded** what I believe will be the most helpful or important. If you just want the overview, I recommend the Introduction, looking over images or anything **bolded** in the body, the Conclusion, and clicking around [NASA’s site on climate change](http://climate.nasa.gov/).

If you don’t believe in climate change, this is not intended to “convert” you. But I hope it will show you the sheer bulk of evidence that has convinced 99.99% of scientists who work in the field (see the section titled “The Scientific Consensus” below).

Climate change is a scientific issue, and a policy issue, but in my mind it is foremost a humanitarian and moral issue. The world’s wealthiest people predominantly caused this problem, but the world’s poorest people will predominantly suffer its effects. For a more detailed analysis of climate change and theology, I wrote an op-ed called [“Climate Change is a Gospel issue.”](https://baptistnews.com/article/climate-change-gospel-issue-time-christians-acknowledged/)

While researching, I have – by both choice and necessity – spent considerable time wandering around corners of the internet that deny the existence of climate change. This depresses me because I believe these perspectives are, intentionally or not, hurting the standard of living of my future children and grandchildren. As a good rule of thumb, I would encourage you to always double-check the sources that individuals use. Specifically, ensure that the source references articles from peer-reviewed journals, which means the content has been analyzed by professionals in the field. There are rigorous systems in place to ensure that peer-reviewed articles are credible, and it’s a big deal to get published. It requires infinitely more credibility than simply making a blog post. If you are ever not sure if something is credible, feel free to send it to me and I’ll check it out for you. In the Age of the Internet, it can be easier than ever for less-credible voices to get attention.

Here’s a general outline that you can use as a table of contents, followed by my take on each topic. I’ve tried to include my references wherever possible so that you can read for yourself, and there are a lot of hyperlinks for easy clicking. The links are also listed at the end of the document. Feel free to email me about climate change or other science issues. I will do my best to answer your questions or steer you towards resources that can. Happy reading.

Matthew Groves

# Intro

To begin, a comment I hear a lot is “It’s arrogant to believe we can change something as large as the climate.” By a charitable reading, this has a nice dose of humility. Unfortunately, it is ultimately an opinion brought to a discussion about facts. A decent metaphor is to say that “It’s arrogant to believe we could destroy the entire Amazon forest” without checking whether or not we’re cutting down trees, and how quickly. In short, I would argue that it’s more arrogant to assume that humanity can do whatever it wants without any consequences.

Two things first, to get your feet wet. The [graph below](https://xkcd.com/1732/) is an accurate, humorous overview to get a feel for the timescale of climate change. The creator, XKCD.com, is a science humor website run by a former NASA employee named Randall Munroe. He got his data from the IPCC, which I’ll discuss below. Quality charts are worth a thousand words, and this is one of the best plots in all of science communication.  It demonstrates that the climate does indeed go through warming cycles, but not with anything approaching the severity of our warming in the last 150 years. I would encourage you to think of a person who lived “a very long time ago” (Jesus, for example) and keep that date in mind as you scroll through:

Second, the graphic below, from [this page](http://www.climate-lab-book.ac.uk/2016/spiralling-global-temperatures/), is an excellent visualization of temperature change over the last century and a half. The author, Dr. Ed Hawkins, is a Meteorologist at the University of Reading in the UK. He also references climate data from the 5th Edition IPCC report, to which he contributed.

# Data and the Science

NASA is heavily involved in climate research (we usually forget about the “Air” in National Aeronautics and Space Administration). NASA has [an entire website](http://climate.nasa.gov/scientific-consensus/) devoted to climate change, which houses huge amounts of resources. I’ve pulled three charts directly from the site here and made a small list of other recommendations below them. I encourage you to click around the “Evidence” and “Consensus” sections on the site and anything else that looks interesting.

**Temperature**: “[This graph](http://climate.nasa.gov/) illustrates the change in global surface temperature relative to 1951-1980 average temperatures. The 10 warmest years in the 136-year record all have occurred since 2000, with the exception of 1998. The year 2015 ranks as the warmest on record.”

[Carbon Dioxide (CO2) levels in the atmosphere](http://climate.nasa.gov/evidence/): 

!["NASA CO2"](assets/images/Climate/NASA_CO2.png)

The climate does indeed go through cycles, as is often noted by climate change skeptics. But not like this, as the figure above shows. For more information about why CO2 and other greenhouse gas levels in the atmosphere matter, look ahead to the section called “The Carbon Cycle and Greenhouse Gases.”

An [update from the 2013 IPCC report](http://climate.nasa.gov/climate_resources/26/), to which 25 NASA scientists contributed:

!["NASA 4 Key Findings"](/assets/images/Climate/NASA_findings.png)

* An [infographic on sea level rise](http://climate.nasa.gov/climate_resources/125/)
* A [time-lapse of global temperatures since 1888](http://climate.nasa.gov/climate_resources/139/) 
    * (Or [the same time-lapse with a cool slider](http://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/global-temperature/)
* A great [interactive page about changing ice levels around the world](http://climate.nasa.gov/interactives/global-ice-viewer/#/)

The IPCC is the Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change, set up in the late 1980s by the United Nations (UN) to analyze the technical literature and provide recommendations for policy makers across the world. It’s perhaps the biggest name in the field, made up of thousands of the most-qualified experts from across the globe; their reports are published by Cambridge University Press. The IPCC has a massive (~1000 page massive) [report](http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg1/ar4_wg1_full_report.pdf) (4th Edition published in 2007, 5th Edition published in 2013) that is the global reference book for the topic. It’s too big to work with here, and too unwieldy to be of much use to anyone without a scientific background. Instead, I’m going to reference a few of its segments, linked below, and use my words as a guide to the primary literature. Narrative summaries are great, but there’s simply too much content for me to write a quality summary of everything (anyway, there are already textbooks on climate change, and I want this to be accessible.) This way, it will be easier for you to use this document as a bridge to the world-class literature itself. I felt the 4th edition had a more introductory, accessible list of FAQs addressed, so I focus more on it here. I attached a [poster](http://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/wg1/docs/WGI_AR5_2013_Poster.pdf) from the 5th edition below, which includes a few of the most important figures. The 5th edition does not overturn or significantly disagree with the conclusions of the 4th edition.

The two segments I’ll be addressing here are the 2007 IPCC Report’s [FAQ](https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg1/ar4-wg1-faqs.pdf) and [Technical Summary](https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg1/ar4-wg1-ts.pdf). Each question in the FAQ segment has a helpful one-page write-up, with the pertinent data and usually a diagram. I’ve listed the questions below for you to browse. Also, see pages 22-23 of the Technical Summary for a list of how the IPCC defines their confidence terms (“very likely” means >90% probability, etc.).

* What Factors Determine Earth’s Climate?
* **What is the Relationship between Climate Change and Weather?**
* What is the Greenhouse effect?
* How do Human Activities Contribute to Climate Change and How do they compare with Natural Influences?
* **How are Temperatures on Earth Changing? (A great chart shows temperatures both in absolute (right vertical axis) and compared to recent averages (left vertical axis). Note the increasing steepness of the rates of change as the timescale becomes more recent.)**
* How is precipitation changing?
* Has there been a change in extreme events like heat waves, droughts, floods, and hurricanes?
* **Is the amount of snow and ice on the earth decreasing? (See especially sea ice and glacier mass balance.)**
* Is Sea Level rising?
* What caused the ice ages and other important climate changes before the industrial era?
* Is the current climate change unusual compared to earlier changes in Earth’s history?
* **Are the increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases during the industrial era caused by human activities? (A very important point about the relationship between sinks and sources. Good to compare with a figure from page 24 of the Technical Summary called “Glacial- Interglacial Ice Core Data.”)**
* How reliable are the models used to make projections of future climate change?
* **Can individual extreme events be explained by greenhouse warming? (The italicized paragraph is an excellent summary.)**
* **Can the warming of the 20th century be explained by natural variability? (The summary paragraph concisely explains why we do not think this is simply caused by natural processes.)**
* Are extreme events, like heat waves, droughts or floods, expected to change as the Earth’s climate changes?
* How likely are major or abrupt climate changes, such as the loss of ice sheets or changes in global ocean circulation?
* If emissions of greenhouse gases are reduced, how quickly to their concentrations in the atmosphere decrease?
* Do projected changes in climate vary from region to region?

(Note: if you want an even more accessible FAQ, the website Grist has [a series of answers](http://grist.org/series/skeptics/) to common questions about climate science. They cite their sources and try to use a bit of humor to lighten the mood.)

The Technical Summary is the synthesized version, a step between the FAQ segment – intended for lawmakers and other scientific laymen – and the full 1,000+ page report. **If you have specific technical questions about anything, doing a word search on the Technical Summary is your next step for digging.** Also, the last 10 pages or so summarize our certainties or uncertainties about all things relative to climate change. **I’ve included a few important ones below that come from the “Robust Findings” category:**

* Current atmospheric concentrations of CO2 and CH4... far exceed those determined from ice core measurements spanning the last 650,000 years. {6.4}
* **Fossil fuel use, agriculture, and land use have been the dominant cause of increases in greenhouse gases over the last 250 years. {2.3, 7.3, 7.4}**
* From new estimates of the combined anthropogenic forcing due to greenhouse gases, aerosols and land surface changes, **it is extremely likely that human activities have exerted a substantial net warming influence on climate since 1750.** {2.9} (Note: “Extremely Likely” is defined as >95% probability.)
* Global mean surface temperatures continue to rise. **Eleven of the last 12 years rank among the 12 warmest years on record since 1850.** {3.2} (Note: As of 2006. This trend has not declined.)
* **The amount of ice on the Earth is decreasing.** There has been widespread retreat of mountain glaciers since the end of the 19th century. The rate of mass loss from glaciers and the Greenland Ice Sheet is increasing. {4.5, 4.6}
* **During the last interglacial, about 125,000 years ago, global sea level was likely 4 to 6m higher than present, due primarily to retreat of polar ice.** {6.4} *(Note: This is what happens if all the ice melts, which the above point indicates is beginning to happen.)*

This image, pulled from the [2013 IPCC Report’s Poster](http://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/wg1/docs/WGI_AR5_2013_Poster.pdf) referenced above, displays the expected changes that would happen to the earth without human influences. I commonly get asked, “Sure, the earth is warming, but how do we know it’s because of people?” This is how we know. The pink shading tells what we expect to happen if considering both natural and human-caused warming, and it overlaps perfectly with the observed temperatures (the lines). The blue shading is what we expect to happen from purely natural causes, and you can see that the observed data (the solid lines) is much higher.

**Extra thought: What’s the difference in weather and climate?** This is a common question, and I appreciated the IPCC reply in the FAQ above: “A common confusion between weather and climate arises when scientists are asked how they can predict climate 50 years from now when they cannot predict the weather a few weeks from now. The chaotic nature of weather makes it unpredictable beyond a few days. Projecting changes in climate (i.e., long-term average weather) due to changes in atmospheric composition or other factors is a very different and much more manageable issue. As an analogy, while it is impossible to predict the age at which any particular man will die, we can say with high confidence that the average age of death for men in industrialized countries is about 75.”
