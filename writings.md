As a science educator for Christians, the majority of questions I receive are about two topics: climate change and evolution. I've written a guide to climate change intended for people of any background, and am in the process of writing several more guides to evolution, the Big Bang, vaccines, and Genesis. I’m also exploring a series of devotionals based on science.

### Climate Change: A Guide For the Perplexed
After receiving many questions about the topic, I wrote an introductory-level guide to climate change. It assumes no scientific background, and it’s ordered by topic so you can easily find what you’re looking for. If you don't believe in climate change, want to know more, or are just confused, this is for you.

            <li> When informed Christians ponder devastation from climate change that will affect millions of people for generations to come, it’s easy to lose hope for the future. But our actions still matter. We must not give up. </li>
