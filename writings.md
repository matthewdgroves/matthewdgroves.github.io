# Writings

As a science educator for Christians, the majority of questions I receive are about two topics: climate change and evolution. I've written a guide to climate change intended for people of any background, and am in the process of writing several more guides to evolution, the Big Bang, vaccines, and Genesis. Iâ€™m also exploring a series of devotionals based on science.
