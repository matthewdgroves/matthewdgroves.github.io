excerpt: "Hello!"

I am a science and faith educator from rural Appalachia. I went to seminary, worked in youth ministry, spent time as a climate activist, and now teach high school science. I hope to draw on my credibility in both scientific and science-skeptical camps to bring harmony and understanding to areas often known for conflict. Iâ€™ve taught nearly 100 science and faith classes to audiences of all ages and denominations, particularly focusing on climate change and building scientific literacy in the Church. 

Please use the contact form if you have any suggestions for new projects or would like me to come talk to your church or group.
