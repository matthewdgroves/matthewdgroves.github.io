excerpt: The science of the novel coronavirus

As you’ve almost certainly heard by now, we’re in the middle of an exponentially-growing outbreak of a new coronavirus (technically, the virus is called SARS-CoV-2 and the disease it causes is COVID-19). You’ve likely seen photos like this on social media:

So: What is this virus? Why should we care? I am a science communicator and educator and have been getting lots of questions about the coronavirus recently, so I decided to write up a primer on the topic to send out. This is part one of three, focusing on the science. I’ve written part two on [the solutions](PartTwoSolutions.md) and part three on [spiritual resources](PartThreeSpirituality.md) for Christians/clergy, which is out now. Feel free to share this around or contact me with questions.
**Part 1: The Science**
Let’s be clear: people buying a years’ worth of toilet paper are panicking. The coronavirus will not end the world. There’s no reason to think that anywhere near a majority of the human race will die, or that we’re facing a post-apocalyptic America like you may have seen in [various](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Stand) [works](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Station_Eleven) of [fiction](https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/5-movies-people-win-for-your-coronavirus-quarantine).
However.
This is not just another flu outbreak. It’s worse, and it’s about to get much worse here in the US. Primarily, the [mortality rate seems to be settling somewhere in the 3–4% rate overall, in contrast with the flu’s typical rate of less than 0.1%.](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200306-sitrep-46-covid-19.pdf?sfvrsn=96b04adf_2) This makes it at least 20 times as fatal as the flu.
First off, it’s called the “corona-virus” because corona means “crown” in Latin, and [the coronavirus has lots of little spikes on its surface.](https://www.ijpr.org/post/older-adults-increased-risk-coronavirus-warns-jackson-county-health-official) The “virus” part of the name is its category. Viruses aren’t even really properly “alive,” just balls of DNA surrounded by a protein wall that’s held together by fat. That’s why everyone is telling you to wash your hands: soap dissolves the fat, which then breaks up the virus.

Now, it is true that most young, healthy people are unlikely to be in serious danger even if they are infected. However, this isn’t quite as good as it seems. First, if you say things like, “only people who are already sick or old are in danger,” you’re effectively telling sick people and older people that you don’t care about their lives. If you’re young and in good health like I am, you might be surprised by the people in your life who are at great risk. If you think of all the people you care about, and look at [the list](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-age-sex-demographics/) below, I’m certain there will be some overlap. People who:
# Are over 60 (and especially over 70, but even those over 50 are at greater risk)
# Have existing lung diseases
# Have a separate serious illness, like cancer
# Have diabetes (like my wife)
# Have received an organ transplant (like my mom and aunt)

### That’s why it’s almost worse that you can contract the disease without it affecting you. Yes, you’ll be fine. But if you’re young and healthy, the danger is not really that you will die. The danger is that you’ll be contagious — without showing symptoms or even knowing you have it — and you’ll infect someone in the group above, whose immune system won’t be able to protect them. ###

And since [America is so, so far behind other countries in our testing](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/3/13/21178289/confirmed-coronavirus-cases-us-countries-italy-iran-singapore-hong-kong), there are almost certainly thousands and thousands more infected people in the US than the official count shows. Because even if we were testing everyone with symptoms, all of the infected people without symptoms would be infecting even more people. If you look at the Chinese region where the outbreak began, we can see that at any point during the growth phase, there were actually [~20 times](https://medium.com/@tomaspueyo/coronavirus-act-today-or-people-will-die-f4d3d9cd99ca) as many real cases (gray bars added up) as diagnosed cases (yellows bars added up):
